## Problem Statement - 
I have the privilege of collaborating with a discrete firm where my relative is employed. While respecting the confidentiality of the organization, I have been granted the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive data analysis project. The dataset, spanning the past three years, is conveniently accessible on their website and is downloadable in both Excel and CSV formats.

My role involves deriving actionable insights from the data. Specifically, I am tasked with identifying the top revenue-generating products, discerning geographical patterns of revenue distribution across states, and formulating strategies to augment sales performance.

I am excited to undertake this project and contribute to enhancing the organization's decision-making processes. I am committed to approaching this analysis with the utmost professionalism and look forward to presenting valuable insights and recommendations that align with the organization's objectives.

## Data Understanding and Preprocessing
They have facilitated my comprehension of the data through organized meetings, effectively addressing any inquiries I had pertaining to the dataset. This involved clarifications on the available columns and their contextual relevance in the business domain. Given the non-uniform nature of the data, the project necessitated both data imputation and manipulation techniques.

The process of comprehending and processing the data was achieved through a collaborative understanding of its significance within the client's context. Their active involvement has proven integral to ensuring accurate data interpretation and subsequent analysis.

This process has been conducted using Python within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Data Visualization
Conducted both univariate and multivariate analyses, which facilitated the identification of inconsistencies within the dataset such as outliers and missing values. Employed missing value imputation techniques to address the gaps in the data, while outliers were appropriately managed using the z-score and capping method.

Furthermore, data visualization was executed through a meticulously designed dashboard, constructed using Microsoft Power BI. This visualization strategy enhances the presentation of insights derived from the analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the data's nuances and trends.
